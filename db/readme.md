- A Dockerfile (`./db/Dockerfile`) has been created to build the MySQL database image, based on the official MySQL image (version 5.7).
- An initialization script (`init.sql`) is provided in the `./db` directory, containing SQL commands to create tables and insert data into the `mydb` database. This script can be customized to match your specific database schema and initial data needs.

The database image has been tagged as `my-mysql-db` and can be built and pushed to Docker Hub using the instructions in this README. The Docker image includes environment variables for the MySQL root user's password (`rootpassword`) and the initial database name (`mydb`).

To run the database service and make it accessible to other services or applications, use Docker Compose as described in Step 6.

For any additional database setup or configuration, please refer to the `Dockerfile` and `init.sql` files in the `./db` directory.

```bash
# Build the database image
docker build -t my-mysql-db ./db

# Push the image to Docker Hub
docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-mysql-db
